- 👋 Hi, I’m @jphooks (Joshua Hooks)
- 👀 I’m interested in sharing code I've written to help other IT professionals
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for M365 Certifications
- 💞️ I love working with computers and technology and am very passionate about what I do on a day to day basis
- 📫 Feel free to send me an email anytime

I hope to use this repository to share code I've written over the years.  It will take some time to sanitize it all so no company specific data is exposed.
